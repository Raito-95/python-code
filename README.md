# Sample Code Repository

This repository, [sample-code](https://github.com/Raito-95/sample-code), is a diverse collection of code samples covering a range of topics in computer science and software development. It's designed to provide practical examples and to demonstrate various programming concepts and techniques.

## Contents

- **[Algorithms](https://github.com/Raito-95/sample-code/tree/main/Algorithms/)**: This section includes implementations of various algorithms, such as sorting algorithms, search algorithms, and others. Each algorithm is accompanied by a detailed explanation and examples.

- **[Applications](https://github.com/Raito-95/sample-code/tree/main/Applications/)**: Here, you'll find practical code samples and tools for everyday tasks and challenges in software development. This includes scripts for automation, data processing, and more.

- **[Audio Processing](https://github.com/Raito-95/sample-code/tree/main/Audio%20Processing/)**: This section contains scripts for handling and processing audio data, demonstrating how to work with sound in your applications.

- **[Data Structures](https://github.com/Raito-95/sample-code/tree/main/Data%20Structures/)**: Explore examples of various data structures, from basic ones like linked lists and stacks to more complex structures like trees and graphs.

- **[Networking and Communication](https://github.com/Raito-95/sample-code/tree/main/Networking%20and%20Communication/)**: This includes code related to network operations, protocols, and communication between systems or devices.

## Testing

The repository includes a comprehensive suite of tests, ensuring the reliability and correctness of the code. We use `pytest`, a powerful testing tool in Python, to automate and manage our tests. This ensures that each script not only performs its intended function but also handles edge cases and errors gracefully.

## Installation

To use these samples, you'll need Python 3.10 and dependencies. Install them with:

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```
