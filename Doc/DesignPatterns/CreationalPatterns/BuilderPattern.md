# Builder Pattern

## Overview

The Builder Pattern is a creational design pattern that provides a method for constructing complex objects without having to directly instantiate their components. This allows client code to avoid dealing with the object's internal structure and instead focus on specifying the type and content of the object to be built.

## Python Implementation

The Builder Pattern typically involves a 'Director' class that delegates construction requests from the client to specific builder objects, each of which is responsible for creating different parts of the object.

### Code Example

```python
# Builder Pattern
class Director:
    def __init__(self, builder):
        self._builder = builder

    def construct_car(self):
        self._builder.create_new_car()
        self._builder.add_model()
        self._builder.add_tires()
        self._builder.add_engine()

class Builder:
    def __init__(self):
        self.car = None

    def create_new_car(self):
        self.car = Car()

class CarBuilder(Builder):
    def add_model(self):
        self.car.model = 'SUV'

    def add_tires(self):
        self.car.tires = 'Off-road tires'

    def add_engine(self):
        self.car.engine = 'Turbo engine'

class Car:
    def __init__(self):
        self.model = None
        self.tires = None
        self.engine = None

    def __str__(self):
        return '{} | {} | {}'.format(self.model, self.tires, self.engine)

# Using the Builder Pattern
builder = CarBuilder()
director = Director(builder)
director.construct_car()
car = builder.car
print(car)  # Output: SUV | Off-road tires | Turbo engine
```

### Test Results

The above code demonstrates how to use the Builder Pattern to construct an instance of a car. The construction process is controlled by the Director object, while the specific building details are managed by the Builder object.

## Conclusion

The Builder Pattern is particularly suited for situations where creating complex objects involves multiple steps. By encapsulating the construction process within a separate Builder object, the pattern makes the code more modular, easier to manage, and extendable.
