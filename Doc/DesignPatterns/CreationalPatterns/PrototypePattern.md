# Prototype Pattern

## Overview

The Prototype Pattern is a creational design pattern used to create objects based on a template of an existing object through cloning. This pattern is particularly useful when the creation of an object is costly or complex, but you need several instances that vary slightly in their initial state.

## Python Implementation

In Python, the Prototype Pattern can be implemented using the `copy` module, which provides the ability to perform shallow and deep copy operations. Here, we'll focus on a simple example that demonstrates cloning an object to create multiple prototypes.

### Code Example

```python
import copy

class Prototype:
    def __init__(self):
        self._objects = {}

    def register_object(self, name, obj):
        """ Register an object with a specific name """
        self._objects[name] = obj

    def unregister_object(self, name):
        """ Remove an object from the registry """
        del self._objects[name]

    def clone(self, name, **attrs):
        """ Clone a registered object and update its attributes """
        obj = copy.deepcopy(self._objects[name])
        obj.__dict__.update(attrs)
        return obj

class Car:
    def __init__(self, model, engine):
        self.model = model
        self.engine = engine

    def __str__(self):
        return f'Model: {self.model}, Engine: {self.engine}'

# Using the Prototype Pattern
prototype = Prototype()
prototype.register_object('skoda', Car('Skoda Octavia', '1.4 TSI'))

car1 = prototype.clone('skoda')
car2 = prototype.clone('skoda', engine='2.0 TSI')

print(car1)  # Output: Model: Skoda Octavia, Engine: 1.4 TSI
print(car2)  # Output: Model: Skoda Octavia, Engine: 2.0 TSI
```

### Test Results

The test demonstrates how we can use the Prototype manager (`Prototype` class) to store a prototypical instance (`Car` object) and create new objects by cloning and optionally modifying their properties.

## Conclusion

The Prototype Pattern allows for flexible object creation by cloning pre-existing objects, which can be more efficient than creating new instances from scratch, especially when dealing with complex objects. This pattern simplifies object creation and reduces the need for subclassing.
